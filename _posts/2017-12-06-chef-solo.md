Running Chef cookbooks without a Chef Server.

solo.rb tell chef-solo where to find the cookbooks :
```ruby
root = File.absolute_path(File.dirname(__FILE__))

file_cache_path root
cookbook_path root + '/cookbooks'
```

attributes.json centralize the node attributes :
```json
{
	"sublime_text": {
		"users": [
			"levasju1"
		]
	},
	"run_list": ["recipe[workstation::default]"]
}
```

Why run :

```bash
sudo chef exec chef-solo -W -c solo.rb -j attributes.json 
```

```bash
sudo chef exec chef-solo -W -c solo.rb -j attributes.json
